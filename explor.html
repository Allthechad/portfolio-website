              <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
              People who love games, and more specifically scavenger hunt players, want an experience that is easy to use, fun and doesn’t hide good features behind a paywall.<br> Users want simple and intuitive interfaces. They also want to share the experience both in-person and on social media.

                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <div class="intro text">After developing the problem statement I interviewed five people to better understand their perspective on mobile games, scavenger hunts and sharing experiences on social media.</div>                
                <h4>Goals:</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>How people share experiences on social media</li>
                <li>How important data usage and coverage is to the average user</li>
                <li>Sites that should be included in a photo scavenger hunt</li>
                <li>How people play games and if they pay for features</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Insights:</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Landmarks and iconic places were most important, second is local restaurants or places that you can only find in that city.</li>
                <li>Social is important to most so having options for social integration is a must and some features such as stickers or geofilters could help make the experience better.</li>
                <li>Tagging on social media is important to the experience for some.</li>
                <li>The need to answer trivia to get clues to the next hunt item should at best be an option. Users seemed to just want a scavenger hunt and that’s all.</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class="intro text">Using the insights gained from the User Interviews I put together three personas to represent the bulk of the target users. These helped direct my decisions throughout the entire design process.</div>

                      <p>
                    <h4>Goals:</h4>

                    <li>Create representatives of larger groups of users</li>
                    <li>Get a clear picture of users' needs, goals, and expectations</li>
                    <li>Find features that apply across all users</li>

                <h3>User Journey</h3>
                With the user personas in hand, I created a user journey for each of the personas. These gave me a starting point to test with users to see if my direction for the app was sound and how it could be refined.
                  <h4>Goals:</h4>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Find the most important features of the app</li>
                  <li>Prioritize aspects of the features most important to users</li>
                  <li>Test with users to see if my hypothesis' were correct</li>
                  <li>Help me understand users feelings and motivations</li>
                  <li>View the experience as a whole rather than a collection of features</li>

                <div class="intro text">
                Choosing some of the main categories of the app I conducted a card sort to see if these made sense to the users or if there were categories they felt should be added and if the way I sorted the information was the most intuitive for them. I tested six participants and used a hybrid, online card sort.</div>
                <h4>Goals:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Test hypothesis for information architecture</li>
                  <li>Decide on the basic structure</li>
                  <li>Find labels for categories</li>

               <div class="intro text"> I began the design process by sketching options for the main screens of the scavenger hunt app. </div>
               <h4>Goals:</h4>

                 <li>Iterate several options quickly</li>

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <div class="intro text">With an idea of the basic layout, I moved to wireframing. The wireframes were created using Adobe Illustrator and XD.</div>
              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Move sketches to the digital space</li>
                <li>Make global design decisions clearer</li>
                <li>Make choices on the priority of content based on space available</li>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <div class="intro text">After developing the wireframes they were then tested with users. I chose six participants that matched the user personas and used moderated in-person testing. The participants were then asked to complete two tasks on both mobile and desktop versions. They were also asked open-ended questions about their experience and asked to talk through their decisions as they made them. </div>
            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn if interactions are intuitive to the user</li>
              <li>Find points of frustration</li>
              <li>Get feedback about the user's feelings of the experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
            <div class="intro text">With the feedback from user testing, I created several rounds of mid-fidelity prototypes which I again tested with a group of users. Based on the feedback from those tests I was able to create high-fidelity prototypes using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and XD. These included colors, a more finished feel and most of the flow of the experience. These were shared with fellow designers to get feedback on the final design. </div>
              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>To test hypothesis' about the flow from screen to screen</li>
                <li>Test the overall visual appeal of the product</li>
                <li>Refine and build out the look and feel of the UI</li>
                <li>To check that the flow met users' needs</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Accessibility Testing and Final Design</h3>
            <div class="intro text">After most of the screens were created I checked the accessibility of the app against WCAG guidelines. In the places it was lacking I made improvements, particularly colors and font sizes.

                Also with feedback from other designers, I made changes to some of the features, navigation, and main screens. The feedback and fresh perspectives were invaluable. In order to build the design and visualize the interactions I used Adobe XD, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop. </div>
            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid low contrast colors</li>
              <li>Make smaller type more legible</li>
              <li>Enlarged buttons and rethink icons</li>
              <li>Get feedback from other designers</li>
              <li>Finalize this phase of the design</li>

              <p class="intro text">Finally, I built the design system using Adobe Illustrator, XD, and Photoshop.</p>
              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Maintain consistency as the app grows</li>
