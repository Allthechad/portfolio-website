    <h1>Chad Ketcham</h1>
    <p>Using my nearly ten years of design experience, I create solutions that are both visually appealing and functional. People face real challenges and hardships every day. Being able to use an app or website shouldn't be one of them. Working with people to identify challenges and creating innovative solutions to remove them from the equation is why I'm excited to get up in the morning.
I've found my niche in UX design and will continue to infuse my previous design skillsets to develop creative solutions that remove barriers and improve usability.
Aside from living in the world of design, I love drinking honey lavender lattes with my fiance, lifting weights at the gym, and turning my nerd level up to 10 watching Marvel movies.
